        <h1><strong>My coding journey - By Jules De Brabander</strong></h1>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                Every coding journey must start <em>somewhere</em>. I wish I could say mine started when I was contemplating 
                creating some amazing tool that would revolutionize the internet. In reality, I was making a workplanner for 
                my team in Excell, continuously thinking there had to be a better way to do this. And then the <strong>FIFTIETH</strong> 
                error broke me. I vowed in that moment that I would learn to program in order to make a lightweight program that would do only 
                what I needed it to do.

                What started out as a spur-of-the-moment decision to rekindle an interest I had had on and off for years in order to 
                solve a very minor issue I was having, quickly expanded in hours scouring the internet for tutorials, blogs, video's and 
                other resources that laid bare an enourmous world for me.
