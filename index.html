        <h1><strong>My coding journey - By Jules De Brabander</strong></h1>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                Every coding journey must start <em>somewhere</em>. I wish I could say mine started when I was contemplating 
                creating some amazing tool that would revolutionize the internet. In reality, I was making a workplanner for 
                my team in Excell, continuously thinking there had to be a better way to do this. And then the <strong>FIFTIETH</strong> 
                error broke me. I vowed in that moment that I would learn to program in order to make a lightweight program that would do only 
                what I needed it to do.
            </p>
            <p>
                What started out as a spur-of-the-moment decision to rekindle an interest I had had on and off for years in order to 
                solve a very minor issue I was having, quickly expanded in hours scouring the internet for tutorials, blogs, video's and 
                other resources that laid bare an enourmous world for me. A world I decided I wanted to understand better. No longer just 
                to make the program I intended to write, but to learn a new skillset, to challenge myself.
            </p>
            <p>
                It never was, and still isn't my goal to switch carreers. I love what I do. But I have comitted myself to this journey. In order 
                not to get lost I decided to primarily follow 2 resources. On the one hand, I would follow the curriculum set out in <a href="https://github.com/ossu/computer-science">the OSSU computer science</a>
                . On the other hand, I would intersperse my classes with <strong>The Odin Project</strong>, a fantastic open-source resource to learn full-stack development.
            </p>
        <h2>The future of this website</h2>
            <p>
                I created this website with the intention of seeing it grow with me. I just made my first push to Github, and plan on doing this for every 
                step of the way. This will help me out in many ways:
                <ol>
                    <li>Create good habits by creating a trail of my code on Github</li>
                    <li>Keep a nice overview of my evolution as a developer, both in how the website evolves and as a homepage for my other projects</li>
                </ol>
            </p>
            <p>So see you soon, maybe even with a website with colour?</p>
